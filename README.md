# Ursula's Lair
This tech test brief was given to me on week 4 of the _nology tech conversion course. Once completed, I decided to take the brief a step forward by personalising it as I liked with a theme of Disney's The Little Mermaid.

## Description
Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet. Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced. Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and can’t be hit again. The game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed.

### Requirements
You should be able to start a new game once the game is over. Some text visualisation of the ships and their hit points. The game should have the following targets:
1 x Mother target
­ 100 Hit Points 
­ Loses 9 hit points every time it is hit 
­ All targets are destroyed if the Mother target is destroyed
5 x Defence targets 
­ Each one starts with 80 hit points 
­ Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit 
8 x Attack targets
­ Each starts with 45 hit points 
­ Each loses 12 hit points each time it is hit.

#### Rules
You may only use JS / CSS / HTML, no frameworks or libraries. You should be able to solve this in under 150 lines including comments and any more than that is a sign you have over complicated the problem. You can use either procedural or object oriented approaches. You can use basic html and css to tidy up the output but no more.
